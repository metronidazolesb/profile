					<h2>Who am I?</h2>
					<p>
						For those of you who do not know me, my name is Sam. I am an early career health practitioner
						who grew up in the Wide Bay region. I thoroughly enjoyed my time there often spending
						too long at the beach playing volleyball and swimming or being towed behind boats up
						and down the Mary River. As all good things do, my time in the Wide Bay came to an end.
					</p>
	
					<p>
						After my time in the Wide Bay, I moved to North Queensland to complete my education.
						In NQ I met many great people with whom I had many adventures around the region.
						I spent some time in NQ, and during that time I fell in love with it. Alas, it would
						not last and I left for work.
					</p>
	
					<p>
						My work has brought me to Central Queensland, closer to home. I have been in CQ for
						two years now and will likely be here for another four as I complete a Master's program.

					<h2>So now you know</h2>
	
					<p>
						...a little about me. If you would like to know more, or learn about things I want to share,
						then please follow this site! I hope to make a blog, perhaps a podcast if I have time and 
						some educational posts.
